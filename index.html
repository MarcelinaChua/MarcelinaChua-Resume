        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a second year majoring in Microbiology at University of California - Riverside and am planning on graduating with a Bachelors in Microbiology. With this in hand, I plan to go to medical school to become a general surgeon or to become a PA through PA school at Loma Linda. With some experiences in hand, the hospital I plan to work at is Loma Linda since I am quite familiar with the hospital since I have been volunteering there since summer 2022. Working at Loma Linda will be a great option since the work life balance is quite proficient since they are lenient about the schedules. They are willing to let you enjoy your vacation while still working hard on the days you are scheduled. The diversity at the hospital is incredible since they serve each culture in the cafeterias. <br><br>

        Experiences I have with the hospital are interacting with the Oncology patients, assisting the secretary, guiding the patient's parents to the waiting room, and running the front desk of the hospital. Interacting with the patients is a great opportunity since it improves my communication skills with the patients. Bonding with the patients gives me an opportunity to understand the pain and appropriate treatment they desire. Interacting with the patients will approve their hospital stay since they will feel welcomed and their voices will be heard. Their visit will increasingly be comfortable while they are treated. Another experience is when I was guiding the patientâ€™s parents across multiple halls to get to the waiting room. It was quite difficult for them since their child was going through surgery. I tried my best to comfort them as we walked down multiple halls. <br><br>

        Past experiences I have with medicine is joining a club called HOSA which stands for the Future Health Occupations of America in high school. During this experience, the teacher trained us through multiple first aid situations. Ranging from a person choking to a burn injury. As we prepared to train, we planned on going to a competition for CPR/ First Aid. During the competition, my partner and I had to assess the scene and perform the appropriate procedures with the given scene. The scenario that was given to us was a burn victim. Following the procedures, we first assessed the scene and took our different routes as I aided the burn victim and she performed CPR on the other victim. I first asked if the patient was okay and introduced myself. I then walked them through the whole process as I wrapped their one arm with burn cream and gauze. After wrapping them up in the burn blanket, I made my way to my partner and assisted in CPR. At the end of the competition, we placed in the top five of the state and were able to move on to nationals.
